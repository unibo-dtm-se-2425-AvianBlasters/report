# Known issues and future work

Overall, Avian Blasters, as a software product, meets all the criteria that were set from the very beginning.

Despite this, there a few aspects that could be improved further and/or added in a future release:
 
1) having the screen and game assets scale properly depending on the screen size of the user's device

2) allowing for accessibility features, such as different colourblindness modes, as there is an extensive use of colours in the game

3) compatibility for devices such as smartphones, with touch controls

4) local multiplayer support

5) power-ups do not change the colour of the car, but create a aura around it, signaling the power-up currently in use. This way, the current health of the player is clearer to understand

6) new power-ups, projectiles and enemy types, including bosses

7) alternate modes of play, such a time attack mode, in which the player must survive for a specific amount of time

8) release on PyPI
