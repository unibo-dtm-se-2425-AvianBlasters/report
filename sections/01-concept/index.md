# Concept

The project envisions the development of a desktop game application with a GUI inspired by arcade games such as Space Invaders and Galaga.

From a use case perspective, users are meant to interact with the software offline on their device when they want to have to play for a few bursts and give their routine a short and fun break.
The system (currently) does not need to store user's data (likely it will not).
In the case of this software project, there is only one kind of role that a user might play, namely the one of the player.
