## Abstract

"Avian Blasters" (or “Avian Blasters: The Avians Strike Back”) is a fixed-screen arcade shoot ’em up inspired by games like Space Invaders and Galaga, developed in Python, which was created for a university Software Engineering Project.

## Disclaimer (if needed)

Throughout the project, ChatGPT was occasionally used as a support resource, particularly to analyze errors and receive suggestions on best practices to follow (for example, to ask which design options were more optimal). All content generated or suggested by the tool was reviewed, adapted, and integrated by the author, who takes full responsibility for the final report/artifact.
(This disclaimer applies specifically to the design and implementation of the game items and to the author who handled them)
